  "content": "Recently Mike Bloomberg tweeted about using open office space to run the presidency if he was to be elected.\n\nSo there has been a lot of discussions lately about how terrible open office plans are however we need to keep in mind the following.\n\n![the way](blob:https://goofy-goldstine-3f3d2a.netlify.app/a7ffd6cd-22ed-41c7-b56a-2ebdf538ccbd)\n\nWe each have our ways and when somebody's way isn't ours take a moment to ask how and why that could work for them. In the current work that I do of programming and with the current co-workers and culture that we have this wouldn't work for us well. I've been a believer for a very long time that open office plans kill productivity and creativity. [The book Joy INC](https://www.amazon.com/Joy-Inc-Built-Workplace-People/dp/1591847125/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=joy+inc&qid=1577899963&sr=8-1) has destroyed that notion for me. This quick interview with Richard Sheridan is a great taste of what the book offers:\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/bHn9t_6G8ro\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nI'm not advocating for open workspaces per se and I don't think Rich is. What he is saying is that there is a better way to do things. But it all starts with self-introspection.\n\nThere is no correct/right/only way to work but there is the way that you work for you. Chances are once you've done the self-introspection you may decide and find the way that you want to work. When you do that you are now empowered to change the circumstances you work in.\n\nWhat changes have I made? I've started experimenting as I can at work with doing more pair programming. Starting small and experiencing small quick failures to find what works the best."
